# Build status

## 2026-09-19: prerequisite gate

Source baseline: `e69eedae94ff6d4f961dbdf048b4133f60f53e82` on Mac and Windows.
Existing user changes to `README.md`, `docs/OVERNIGHT.md`, and untracked
`Dev-Machine-Setup.md` are preserved. Nothing pushed or published.

Coordinator owns scaffolding, contracts, orchestration, Windows synchronization,
builds, and this record. Workers start after the native scaffold/contracts gate,
with exclusive ownership as specified in `OVERNIGHT.md`.

Prerequisite evidence:

- User clarified that `runsup` meant `rustup`.
- Mac: rustup 1.29.1, Rust/Cargo 1.98.1, rustfmt and Clippy installed and on PATH.
- Mac: Node 22.22.0, pnpm 9.12.0, Git 2.51.2; Apple Command Line Tools available.
- Mac: standalone `rustc` compilation and executable probe passed.
- Windows: SSH BatchMode login succeeded; `C:\codeme\git-view` is a clean checkout.
- Windows: Rust/Cargo 1.98.1, rustfmt and Clippy installed; MSVC target selected.
- Windows: WebView2 runtime directory version 153.0.4234.32 exists; GUI smoke pending.
- Windows: Node 22.22.2 found in fnm storage but absent from SSH PATH; pnpm absent.
- Windows: standalone Rust compilation failed: `link.exe` not found.
  Visual Studio Professional 2022 is installed without detected C++ compiler tools.

Reproducible remote checks: `python3 scripts/windows-remote.py scripts/windows-preflight.ps1`.
Setup script prepared to expose existing Node for the build session, install pnpm
in the checkout-local `.tools` directory, and add the Visual Studio C++ workload.

M1, M2, M3: not started; no application acceptance checks or release builds yet.
Next: finish prerequisite repair, compile the minimal native shell, freeze shared
contracts/fixtures, then assign Git, repository UI, and group UI workers.
